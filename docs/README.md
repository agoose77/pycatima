Python Module
-------------
Python module can be installed directly from PyPI using pip:
```bash
pip install pycatima
```

Or installed by cloning the Git repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrosiak/pycatima.git
```
and installing with pip
```bash
pip install ./pycatima
```

C++ Library
------------
CMake is used to build the library. For a default build, first prepare the build location

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

## System-wide install
Simply configure, build, and install the library
```bash
cmake ../
make
make install
```

## Local install
First, configure, build, and install the library into a prefix; replacing `<PATH-TO-INSTALL>` with the install location.
```bash
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH-TO-INSTALL>
make
make install
```

Then, update the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variables:
```bash
PATH="<PATH-TO-INSTALL>/bin:$PATH"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<PATH-TO-INSTALL>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```


cmake options
-------------
compile options, enable or disable with cmake:
```bash
cmake ../ -D[OPTION]
```

available options:
  * BUILD_SHARED_LIBS - if ON shared library is build, otherwise static
  * APPS - build command line app, default ON
  * TESTS - build tests, default OFF
  * EXAMPLES - build examples, default OFF
  * DOCS - prepare doxygen documentation (after cmake, __make docs__ needs to be executed)
  * GENERATE_DATA - makes program to re-generate precalculated tables (ie precalculated LS coefficients), default:OFF
  * THIN_TARGET_APPROXIMATION - compile the library with thin target approximation, default: ON
  * GSL_INTEGRATION - use GSL integration functions, otherwise use built-in integrator, default: OFF
  * GLOBAL - compile with GLOBAL code (source not included at the moment, needs to be manually added to __global__ directory, default:OFF)
  * STORE_SPLINES - store splines in cache, if disabled datapoints are stored and splines are recreated, default ON

ie:
```bash
cmake -DEXAMPLES=ON ../
```
